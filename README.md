# SocialMedia_Followers_prediction

There are so many social media platforms today where you will find so many content creators in so many types of fields. As a social media consumer, 
the number of followers you have may not be of interest to you, but as a content creator or as a businessman, the number of followers you have is important 
for your content for reaching more audience. So, the task of social media followers prediction is very valuable for every content creator and every 
business that relies on social media. 

To predict the increase in the number of followers you can expect to see, you need a dataset of your social media followers that can show you the 
activities of people in your social media account like:

how many people have followed you every month 
how many views results in how many followers 
how many of your followers unfollow you every month

So it is very difficult to find such a dataset among the most common social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram as these platforms do not provide any 
data related to your followers. So for the task of social media followers prediction with machine learning, I collected data from my social media account on Medium, 
which is a social media platform for content writers, bloggers, and researchers. You can use the same process on your dataset whether you get it from Medium, 
Instagram, or any other social media application to predict your social media followers.
